This is the creation of Pivot Tables in excel for bike sales dataset

The pivot tables that have been created are :
- Total profits per company (Filtered by age groups)
- The amount made each year by countries
- The amount of product bought categories by gender (Filtered by Country)

This project was completed in order to show simple ways that tables can
be formed in excel in order to provide generalized/simple information.

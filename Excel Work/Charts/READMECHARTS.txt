This is a folder that contains all of the chart work that is done in excel.

It shows all of the projects that have been completed with the creation
of charts in order to represent what the datasets are showing.

They show a simplified version of information and allows for people to infer
for what the data is storing. 

It also provides a quick glance at what further work can be done such as 
carrying on the project if there is a lot of information or to end it at this
point.
